# Evently

This was made for a [coding challenge](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-private-events) from a course on Rails.

I used a modified version of [bounce.css](https://replit.com/@Bookie0/bouncecss?v=1) by [@Bookie0](https://replit.com/@Bookie0)

Right now it's just running in dev mode so it's liable to crash, or show weird rails errors.

Anyway, enjoy :)
